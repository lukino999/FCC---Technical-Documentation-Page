# Technical documentation page
I built this page following [this assignment](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) .
I used [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting.
The page is live [here](https://codepen.io/lukino999/full/pBQvmB).
